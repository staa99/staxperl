Staa expert language : Expert systems made easy

This work started as a way of simplifying my work and that of a client I once helped with his work.
I was to build a system for him that combines the use of a fuzzy based expert system with popular biometrics.

Note: I have never written a language before this, and this is a very simple language.

There are three groups of statements in a context.
A context is defined by a single file. A context defines input and output variables as well as fuzzy sets and
fuzzy rules that are eventually used to determine values for output variables.

That's really all there is to this language for now, maybe you could extend it for the world to use.
